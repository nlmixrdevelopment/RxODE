(e.g., doses) to the dynamic system and observation sampling
time points (see \code{\link[=eventTable]{eventTable()}});}

\item{inits}{a vector of initial values of the state variables
(e.g., amounts in each compartment), and the order in this
vector must be the same as the state variables (e.g., PK/PD
compartments);}

\item{scale}{a numeric named vector with scaling for ode
parameters of the system.  The names must correspond to the
parameter identifiers in the ODE specification. Each of the
ODE variables will be divided by the scaling factor.  For
example \code{scale=c(center=2)} will divide the center ODE
variable by 2.}

\item{method}{The method for solving ODEs.  Currently this supports:
\itemize{
\item \code{"liblsoda"} thread safe lsoda.  This supports parallel
thread-based solving, and ignores user Jacobian specification.
\item \code{"lsoda"} -- LSODA solver.  Does not support parallel thread-based
solving, but allows user Jacobian specification.
\item \code{"dop853"} -- DOP853 solver.  Does not support parallel thread-based
solving nor user Jacobain specification
\item \code{"indLin"} -- Solving through inductive linearization.  The RxODE dll
must be setup specially to use this solving routine.
}}

\item{transitAbs}{boolean indicating if this is a transit
compartment absorption}

\item{atol}{a numeric absolute tolerance (1e-8 by default) used
by the ODE solver to determine if a good solution has been
achieved;  This is also used in the solved linear model to check
if prior doses do not add anything to the solution.}

\item{rtol}{a numeric relative tolerance (\code{1e-6} by default) used

during one call to the solver. (5000 by default)}

\item{hmin}{The minimum absolute step size allowed. The default
value is 0.}

\item{hmax}{The maximum absolute step size allowed.  When
\code{hmax=NA} (default), uses the average difference +
hmaxSd*sd in times and sampling events. The \code{hmaxSd} is a user
specified parameter and which defaults to zero.  When
\code{hmax=NULL} RxODE uses the maximum difference in times in
your sampling and events.  The value 0 is equivalent to infinite
maximum absolute step size.}

\item{hmaxSd}{The number of standard deviations of the time

is equivalent to calling \code{\link[=setRxThreads]{setRxThreads()}}}

\item{covsInterpolation}{specifies the interpolation method for
time-varying covariates. When solving ODEs it often samples
times outside the sampling time specified in \code{events}.
When this happens, the time varying covariates are
interpolated.  Currently this can be:
\itemize{
\item \code{"linear"} interpolation, which interpolates the covariate
by solving the line between the observed covariates and extrapolating the new
covariate value.
\item \code{"constant"} -- Last observation carried forward (the default).
\item \code{"NOCB"} -- Next Observation Carried Backward.  This is the same method
that NONMEM uses.
\item \code{"midpoint"} Last observation carried forward to midpoint; Next observation
carried backward to midpoint.

to the output matrix or data frame. By default this is
disabled.}

instead of the RxODE's solved object.}

covariance matrix.  The names of the columns indicate

Cholesky decomposition instead of a symmetric covariance}

\item{sigmaSeparation}{separation strategy for sigma;

equal to the degrees of freedom \code{nu} by \code{(nu-1)/2}
\item \code{"separation"} simulates from the identity inverse Wishart
covariance matrix with \code{nu} degrees of freedom.  This is then
converted to a covariance matrix and augmented with the modeled
standard deviations.  While computationally more complex than the
\code{"lkj"} prior, it performs better when the covariance matrix
size is greater or equal to 10
\item \code{"auto"} chooses \code{"lkj"} when the dimension of the
matrix is less than 10 and \code{"separation"} when greater
than equal to 10.
}}

\item{sigmaXform}{When taking \code{sigma} values from the \code{thetaMat}
simulations (using the separation strategy for covariance

supplied instead of an event table.  This is for importing the
data as an RxODE event table.}

\item{stiff}{a logical (\code{TRUE} by default) indicating whether
the ODE system is stiff or not.\preformatted{For stiff ODE systems (`stiff = TRUE`), `RxODE` uses the
LSODA (Livermore Solver for Ordinary Differential Equations)
Fortran package, which implements an automatic method switching
for stiff and non-stiff problems along the integration
interval, authored by Hindmarsh and Petzold (2003).

For non-stiff systems (`stiff = FALSE`), `RxODE` uses
DOP853, an explicit Runge-Kutta method of order 8(5, 3) of
Dormand and Prince as implemented in C by Hairer and Wanner
(1993).

If stiff is not specified, the `method` argument is used instead.

EVID and related columns.  This will also include dosing

only includes estimates at the observations. (default

include \code{EVID=0} on solve and exclude any model-times or
\code{EVID=2}. If \code{addDosing} is \code{NA} the classic
\code{RxODE} EVID events are returned. When \code{addDosing} is \code{TRUE}
add the event information in NONMEM-style format; If
\code{subsetNonmem=FALSE} RxODE will also include extra event types
(\code{EVID}) for ending infusion and modeled times:
\itemize{

off (matches \code{rate=-1})
\item \code{EVID=-2} When the modeled duration infusions are
turned off (matches \code{rate=-2})

method in RxODE,  is used for \code{rxSolve(object, ...)}, \code{solve(object,...)},
\item \code{"data.frame"} -- returns a plain, non-reactive data
frame; Currently very slightly faster than \code{returnType="matrix"}

to the solved object.  This is what is used \code{object$run} as well as \code{object$solve}

then at least \code{minSS} doses are administered and the
total number of steady states doses will continue until
\code{maxSS} is reached, or \code{atol} and \code{rtol} for
every compartment have been reached.  However, if ODE solving
problems occur after the \code{minSS} has been reached the
whole subject is considered an invalid solve. If
\code{strictSS} is \code{FALSE} then as long as \code{minSS}

been achieved.}

hmxi = 0.0 is allowed and corresponds to an infinite \verb{hmax1 (default).  }hmin\code{and}hmxi\verb{may be changed at any time, but will not take effect until the next change of}H\verb{is considered. This option is only considered with}method="liblsoda"`.}

Hence the default is \code{resampleID=TRUE}.}

\item{maxwhile}{represents the maximum times a while loop is
evaluated before exiting.  By default this is 100000}

\item{a}{when using \code{solve()}, this is equivalent to the
\code{object} argument.  If you specify \code{object} later in
the argument list it overwrites this parameter.}

\item{b}{when using \code{solve()}, this is equivalent to the
\code{params} argument.  If you specify \code{params} as a
named argument, this overwrites the output}
}
\value{
An \dQuote{rxSolve} solve object that stores the solved
value in a special data.frame or other type as determined by
\code{returnType}. By default this has as many rows as there are
sampled time points and as many columns as system variables (as
defined by the ODEs and additional assignments in the RxODE model
code).  It also stores information about the call to allow
dynamic updating of the solved object.

The operations for the object are similar to a data-frame, but
expand the \code{$} and \verb{[[""]]} access operators and assignment
operators to resolve based on different parameter values, initial
conditions, solver parameters, or events (by updating the \code{time}
variable).

You can call the \code{\link[=eventTable]{eventTable()}} methods on the solved object to
update the event table and resolve the system of equations.

\description{
This uses RxODE family of objects, file, or model specification to
solve a ODE system.  There are many options for a solved RxODE
model, the first are the required \code{object}, and \code{events} with the
some-times optional \code{params} and \code{inits}.
}
\details{
The rest of the document focus on the different ODE solving
methods, followed by the core solving method's options, RxODE event
handling options, RxODE's numerical stability options, RxODE's
output options, and finally internal RxODE options or compatibility
options.
