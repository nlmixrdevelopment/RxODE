Description: Facilities for running simulations from ordinary
    differential equation (ODE) models, such as pharmacometrics and other
    compartmental models.  A compilation manager translates the ODE model
    into C, compiles it, and dynamically loads the object code into R for
    improved computational efficiency.  An event table object facilitates
    the specification of complex dosing regimens (optional) and sampling
    schedules.  NB: The use of this package requires both C and
    Fortran compilers, for details on their use with R please see
    Section 6.3, Appendix A, and Appendix D in the "R Administration and
    Installation" manual. Also the code is mostly released under GPL.  The
    VODE and LSODA are in the public domain.  The information is available
    in the inst/COPYRIGHTS.
