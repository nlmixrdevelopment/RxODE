## ODE solving

This is a brief comparison of pharmacometric ODE solving R packages to
`RxODE`.

There are several [R packages for differential
equations](https://CRAN.R-project.org/view=DifferentialEquations).
The most popular is
[deSolve](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=deSolve).

However for pharmacometrics-specific ODE solving, there are only 2
packages other than [RxODE](https://cran.r-project.org/package=RxODE)
released on CRAN. Each uses compiled code to have faster ODE solving.

-   [mrgsolve](https://cran.r-project.org/package=mrgsolve), which uses
    C++ lsoda solver to solve ODE systems. The user is required to write
    hybrid R/C++ code to create a mrgsolve model which is translated to
    C++ for solving.

    In contrast, `RxODE` has a R-like mini-language that is parsed into
    C code that solves the ODE system.

    Unlike `RxODE`, `mrgsolve` does not currently support symbolic
    manipulation of ODE systems, like automatic Jacobian calculation or
    forward sensitivity calculation (`RxODE` currently supports this and
    this is the basis of
    [nlmixr](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=nlmixr)'s FOCEi
    algorithm)

-   [dMod](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=dMod), which uses a unique
    syntax to create "reactions". These reactions create the underlying
    ODEs and then created c code for a compiled deSolve model.

    In contrast `RxODE` defines ODE systems at a lower level. `RxODE`'s
    parsing of the mini-language comes from C, whereas `dMod`'s parsing
    comes from R.

    Like `RxODE`, `dMod` supports symbolic manipulation of ODE systems
    and calculates forward sensitivities and adjoint sensitivities of
    systems.

    Unlike `RxODE`, `dMod` is not thread-safe since `deSolve` is not yet
    thread-safe.

And there is one package that is not released on CRAN:

-   [PKPDsim](https://github.com/InsightRX/PKPDsim) which defines models
    in an R-like syntax and converts the system to compiled code.

    Like `mrgsolve`, `PKPDsim` does not currently support symbolic
    manipulation of ODE systems.

    `PKPDsim` is not thread-safe.

The open pharmacometrics open source community is fairly friendly, and
the RxODE maintainers has had positive interactions with all of the
ODE-solving pharmacometric projects listed.

## PK Solved systems

`RxODE` supports 1-3 compartment models with gradients (using stan
math's auto-differentiation). This currently uses the same equations as
`PKADVAN` to allow time-varying covariates.

`RxODE` can mix ODEs and solved systems.

### The following packages for solved PK systems are on CRAN

-   [mrgsolve](https://cran.r-project.org/package=mrgsolve) currently
    has 1-2 compartment (poly-exponential models) models built-in. The
    solved systems and ODEs cannot currently be mixed.
-   [pmxTools](https://github.com/kestrel99/pmxTools) currently have 1-3
    compartment (super-positioning) models built-in. This is a R-only
    implementation.
-   [PKPDmodels](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=PKPDmodels)
    has a one-compartment model with gradients.

### Non-CRAN libraries:

-   [PKADVAN](https://github.com/abuhelwa/PKADVAN_Rpackage) Provides 1-3
    compartment models using non-superpositioning. This allows
    time-varying covariates.
